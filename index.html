                <h2>Christopher Lloyd couldn't have foreseen this "Future"</h2>
                <p>
                    New York — This month, the Chicago Cubs are one of four teams
                    going to bat in the MLB playoffs.
                    If they win the World Series, it'd fulfill a prophecy made by
                    Back to the Future, Part II in 1989,
                    when Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) time-traveled to Oct. 21, 2015,
                    and discovered that the Cubs had won their first since 1908.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's an eerie coincidence that isn't lost on Christopher Lloyd,
                    who played kooky scientist "Doc" Emmett Brown in the beloved sci-fi
                    comedy trilogy, which celebrates its 30th anniversary this year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>It's wonderful. It'd be a real kick if they could pull it off
                    and win the series,</q> says Lloyd, 76, still wide-eyed and wild-haired
                    like his iconic character, but far more soft-spoken.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The date wasn't chosen arbitrarily. <q>In 1989, there was only
                    one set of baseball playoffs instead of two,
                    so Oct. 21 would have been a likely date for the World Series
                    to end if the Cubs had swept the team from Miami,</q>screenwriter
                    Bob Gale says.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sequel's other projections are further outfield.
                    In the hypothetical 2015 that Marty and Doc visit, sneakers
                    tie themselves, moviegoers devour Jaws 19 and fax machines
                    aren't yet the relics they are now. In one scene, a bully's
                    "hoverboard rampage" is the top headline on an ultramodern
                    copy of USA TODAY, which uses a drone to snap the front-page
                    photo. Of all the movie's seemingly unattainable gadgets,
                    <q>hoverboards seem to be on the edge of actually becoming a reality,</q>
                    Lloyd says. <q>Flying cars? I don't know, that's complicated.</q>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fans certainly shouldn't cross their fingers for a dimension-bending
                    coupe like Doc's DeLorean, which was introduced in Robert Zemeckis'
                    first Back to the Future on July 3, 1985. Making a star of Fox and
                    becoming the highest-grossing film of that year ($210.6 million
                    to date),  the rip-roaring adventure spawned two sequels in 1989
                    and 1990, and has remained a pop-culture touchstone ever since.
                    Theaters nationwide are hosting anniversary screenings Wednesday,
                    and the trilogy gets its DVD/Blu-ray box-set release this week.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Three decades later, Future has endured because it's <q>entertaining,
                    funny and crazy, but also because of its relatable themes and
                    emotional resonance,</q> says Lea Thompson, who played Marty's mother,
                    Lorraine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>I really do believe the central construct is that one moment of
                    courage can change your entire life,</q> Thompson says. <q>The idea of
                    doing the right thing, to protect someone you love. To kiss someone
                    and know that they are not right for you. To put an end to bullying.
                    Whatever it is that happens in that moment in the movie, it’s
                    a powerful concept and lesson to teach your children.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for the possibility of a fourth Future, Lloyd says he
                    would consider it — but only if the original cast and creative team
                    returned, and if there was a story worth telling.
                    <q>There's always the danger of sequels not living up to the original,
                    so it'd have to be something momentous and current: dealing with ISIS
                    or climate change or something radical and have a real urgency to it,</q>
                    Lloyd ponders. <q>I don't know what that would be.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sequel or not, that hasn't stopped Lloyd from putting on the lab coat
                    again through the years, voicing Doc in the Future animated series in
                    the early '90s, making character cameos in Adult Swim's Robot Chicken
                    and last year's A Million Ways to Die in the West, and even calling up
                    famous lines when he meets fans on the street.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>People always want to hear 'Great Scott!' and 'Roads? Where we're going,
                    we don't need roads,'</q> Lloyd smiles. <q>I'm happy to do it, if I'm not in
                    a rush."</q>
                </p>
